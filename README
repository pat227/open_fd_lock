This small code base provides Ocaml open file descriptor locks (see http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_mono/libc.html#Open-File-Description-Locks). These locks are available in more recent linux kernels but not yet available in Ocaml through Pervasives or Core. Note that "In contrast to process-associated record locks (see File Locks), open file description record locks are associated with an open file description rather than a process."
